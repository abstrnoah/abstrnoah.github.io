Hello and welcome to my homepage :D

* I'm a long-time __[Linux][5] terminal user__ who relies on [Git][git] and
  [Vim][vim] for just about everything. A more comprehensive list of tools I
  love is [over here](/wiki/tools). You can see my [dotfiles][dotfiles]

  dotfiles should be :).

  [Caltech][caltech], and will be pursuing a PhD in mathematics or computer
  science following a much-needed gap year, during which I continue a research
  project (notes forthcoming) in [descriptive set theory][dst] with mentor

  (among others) of the House's various computing systems.

* As of the [latest commit][headrev], I was __reading__ [_The
  Witcher_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher) series and [Graeber's
  _Debt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years).

* Please feel free to send me __anonymous feedback__ via [this form][2].
